# **App Name**: CLI Portfolio

## Core Features:

- CLI Navigation: Simulate a command-line interface (CLI) with menus navigable via arrow keys.
- Menu Display: Display 'Home', 'About Me', 'Works', and 'Contact' menus within the CLI.
- Content Rendering: Render profile information and project details in the style of command-line output.
- AI-Powered Help: An AI "tool" generates relevant, dynamic command-line 'help' and 'usage' documentation for each command.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Green (#00FF00) for text, mimicking classic CLI output.
- Background color: Near-black (#101010) for the terminal background. 2% saturation of Green hue. Dark color scheme appropriate, due to desire to resemble command prompt.
- Accent color: Yellow (#FFFF00) for occasional highlights and prompts. Chosen for its contrast, as an analogous color at ~30 degrees from green in the hue wheel.
- Font: 'Source Code Pro', a monospaced font for the CLI look. 
- Use simple, monochrome icons to represent directories or files. Very subtle.
- Layout mimics a terminal window, with a prompt area and output display.
- Simulate text typing with a cursor blinking at the end of the line.
